<p align="left"><font size="4">It was a cold and silent night . The weather was 
freezing cold . A group of monkeys were on a tree . they were&nbsp; clinging to 
its branches . one of the monkeys Said &quot; I wish we could find some fire . It 
will help us to keep warm </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Suddenly the noticed a flock of fireflies One of 
the young monkeys thought it was fire &gt; he caught a firefly , he put it under a 
dry leaf and started blowing at it some other monkeys also joined in his efforts</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">In the meanwhile , a sparrow came flying to its 
nest which was on the same tree the monkeys were doing . the sparrow laughed . 
she said , &quot;Hey silly monkeys , That is a firefly , not real fire . I think all 
of you should take shelter in a cave</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The monkeys did not listen to the Sparrow . they 
continued to blow at the poor firefly</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">After some time , the monkeys became very tired 
Now they realized that what the sparrow had said was correct . They set free the 
firefly and moved to nearby cave</font></p>
