<p align="left"><font size="4">Along time ago , there was a huge apple tree . A 
little boy loved to come and play around it everyday . He climbed to the treetop 
ate the apples , took a nap under the shadow He loved the tree and the tree 
loved to play with him Time went by the&nbsp; little boy had grown up and he no 
longer played around the tree every day </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One day , the boy came back to the tree and he 
looked sad , Come and play with me the tree asked the boy. I am no longer a kid 
, I do not play around trees any more , the boy replied , I wan t toys . I need 
money to buy them , Sorry but i do not have money But you can pick all my apples 
and sell them , So you will have money . The boy Was so excited He grabbed all 
the apples on the tree and lift happily . the boy never came back after he 
picked the apples. the tree was sad</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One day , the boy who now turned into a man 
returned and the tree was excited , Come and play with me the tree said , I do 
not have time to play . I have to work for my family . We need a house for 
shelter . Can You help me? Sorry but I do not have any house . But you Can chop 
off my branches to build your house , So the man cut all the branches of the 
tree and lift happily the tree was glad to see him happy but the man never came 
back since then . the tree was again lonely and sad </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One hot summer day , the man returned and the 
tree was delighted , Come and play with me , The tree said I am Getting old , I 
want to go sailing to relax myself . Can you give me a boat? Said the man. Use 
my trunk to Build your boat . you can sail far away and be happy ,So the man cut 
the tree trunk to make a boat He went sailing and never showed up for a long 
time</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Finally the man returned after many years &gt;Sorry 
my boy . But I do not have anything for you anymore No more apples for you The 
tree said . No problem I do not have any teeth to bite the man replied No more 
trunk for you&nbsp; to climb on The tree said . I am too old for that now the 
man said I really can&nbsp; not give you any thing The only thing lift&nbsp; is 
my dying roots the tree said with tears I do not need much now just a place to 
rest . I am tired after all these years the man replied Good Old tree&nbsp; 
roots are the best place to lean on and rest , come come sit down with me and 
rest The man Sit down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Moral : The tree is like our parents When we were 
young , We loved to play with our Mum and Dad .. When we grow up , we leave them 
.. only come to them When we need something or when we are in trouble . No 
matter what , Parents will&nbsp; always be there and give every thing&nbsp; they 
could just to make you happy you may think&nbsp; the boy is cruel to the tree , 
but&nbsp; that is how all of us treat our parents . We take them for granted we 
do not appreciate all they do for us until&nbsp; it is too late</font></p>
