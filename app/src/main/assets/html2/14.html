<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">A frail old man went to live with his 
son , daughter - in -law and four -year old grandson .The ld man`s hands 
trembled , his eyesight was blurred , and his step faltered / the family ate 
together at the table . but the elderly grandfather`s shaky hands and failing 
sight made eating difficult . peas rolled off his spoon onto the flower. When he 
grasped the glass , milk spilled on the table cloth </font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">The son and daughter in law became 
irritated with the mess . We must do something about father , Said the son I 
have had enough of his spilled milk noisy eating , and wife se&nbsp; a small 
table in the corner . there Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family 
enjoyed dinner . since Grandfather had broken a dish or two , his food was 
served in a wooden bowl ! When the family glanced in Grandfather`s directions, 
sometime he had&nbsp; a tear in his eye as he sat alone still , the only words 
the couple had for him where sharp admonitions when he dropped a four or spilled 
food </font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">The Four year old watched it all in 
silence</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">One Evening before supper , the father 
noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor . He asked the child 
sweetly the boy responded , oh I am making a little bowl for you and&nbsp; Mama 
to eat your food in when I grow up , The Four old smiled and went back to work.</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">The words so struck the parents so that 
the were speechless . than tears started to stream down their cheeks&nbsp; 
Though no word was spoken , both know what must be done </font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">The Evening the husband took 
Grandfather`s hand and gently led him back to family table . for the remainder 
of his days he ate every meal with the family . And for some reason neither 
husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped milk spilled 
, or the tablecloth soiled</font></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr"><font size="4">Moral :You reap what you saw Regardless 
of your relationship with your parents , you will miss them when they are gone 
from your life . Always Respect Care for and love them</font></p>
