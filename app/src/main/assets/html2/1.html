<p align="left"><font size="4">One beautiful spring morning, a merchant loaded 
his donkey with bags of salt . the merchant and his donkey were walking along 
together .They had not walked far when they reached a river on the way.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp; Unfortunately , the donkey slipped and 
fell into the river .As it scrambled up the bank of the river , it noticed that 
the bags of salt loaded on his back had become lighter.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">There was nothing the merchant could do except 
return home, where he loaded his donkey with more bags of salt .As they reached 
the slippery riverbank again ,the donkey fell into the river, this time 
deliberately .Thus the salt was wasted again.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">By now the merchant knew the donke`s trick. He 
wanted to teach the animal a lesson .As he returned home the second time with 
the donkey , the merchant loaded bags of sponges on its back.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The due set out on their tripe to the market a 
third time . On reaching the river , the donkey very cleverly fell into the 
water again. But now , instead of the load becoming lighter, it became heavier.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The merchant laughed at the donkey and said &quot;You 
foolish donkey , your trick has been discovered .You should know that you can 
not fool anyone too many times.&quot; </font></p>
