<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#808000">The Rope</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The night fell heavy on the heights of the 
mountains and the man could not see anything . there was zero visibility the 
moon and the stars were covered by the clouds</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">When he was just a few feet below the top of the 
mountain , he slipped and fell into the air , falling at great speed he could 
see only black spots as he went down , and feel the terrible sensation of being 
sucked in by gravity</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">He kept falling , and in those moments of great 
fear ,all the good and bad episodes of his life came to his mind . he was&nbsp; 
thinking now about how close death was getting , when all of a sudden he felt 
the rope tied to his waist pull him very hard . His body was hanging in the air 
Only the rope was holding him . In that moment of stillness he had no choice 
other than scream , &quot;help me God</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">All of sudden , a deep voice coming from the sky 
answered &quot;What do you want me to do ?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Save Me God</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&quot;Do you really think I can save you ?&quot; of course 
, I believe you can &quot; &quot; Then cut the rope tied to your waist</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">There was a moment of silence . the moment passed 
, and the man decided hold on to the rope with all his strength</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The rescue team says that the next day , the 
climber&nbsp; was found dead and frozen his body hanging from a rope , and his 
hands holding it tight , he was only one foot away from the ground</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">He attached are we to our ropes ? will we let 
them go? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Do not ever doubt God We should Have enough faith 
to cut the rope , if that is what God tells us to do , even when it seems to be 
the most foolish thing to do&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
