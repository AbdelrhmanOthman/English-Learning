<p align="left"><font size="4">One hot day &lt; an ant was searching for some water 
.After walking&nbsp; around for some time , she came to a spring .To reach the 
spring , she had to climb up a blade of grass .while making her way up , she 
slipped and fell into the water.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby&nbsp; 
tree had not seen her .seeing that the ant was in trouble , the dove quickly 
plucked a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant . the ant 
moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it . soon , the leaf drifted to dry 
ground , and the ant jumped out , she was safe at last</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Just at the time , a hunter nearby was about to 
throw his net over the dove , hoping to trap it </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Guessing what has was about to do , the ant 
quickly bit him on the heel . feeling the pain , the hunter dropped his net the 
dove was quick to fly away to safety .</font></p>
