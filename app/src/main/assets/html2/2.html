<p align="left"><font size="4">Once upon a time ,There lived a generous and kind 
-hearted king .But the people were not happy with their king because was very 
lazy and would not do any thing other than eating and sleeping</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">He spent days and weeks and months in his bed 
either eating something or sleeping. the king became a potato couch and the 
people started to worry about the king</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One day , the king realized that he could not 
even move his body , not even his foot . He became very fat and his enemies mad 
fun of him ,calling him 'fatty king', 'bulky king ' etc</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The king invited expert doctors from various 
parts of his country and offered them generous rewards to make him fit . 
Unfortunately , non could help the king gain his health and fitness . the king 
spent enormous amounts of money but went in vain.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One fine morning. a holy man visited the country 
.He heard about the ill-health of the king ,and informed the minister at the 
place that he could easily cure the king ,Hearing these promising words, the 
minister became very happy .He requested the king to meet the holy man to get 
rid of his problem.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The holy man resided at a distant place . Since 
the king could not move his body , he asked the minister to bring the holy man 
to the palace , but the holy man refused .He said that the king had to go to him 
, in order to get cured.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">After strenuous efforts the king met the holy man 
at the latter`s residence. The holy man complimented the king saying that he was 
a good ruler, and said that he would soon regain his health .He asked the king 
to come for treatment the next day .He told the king also that the king would be 
treated only if he came on foot to the holy man`s residence</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The king was unable to walk even a few steps on 
the road , but aided by his followers, he reached the holy man`s place 
.Unfortunately ,the holy man was not available there and his devotee requested 
the king to come and meet him the next day for treatment</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">This was repeated for two weeks and the king 
never met the holy man , and never had any treatment</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Gradually , the king realized that he felt a lot&nbsp; 
lighter , lost a considerable amount of weight and felt more active than before 
.He realized the reason why the holy man asked him to reach his place by 
walking.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Very soon , the king regained his health and the 
people were very happy in his kingdom</font></p>
