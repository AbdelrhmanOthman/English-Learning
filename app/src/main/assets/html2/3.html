<p align="left"><font size="4">Once , There was a poor boy who made a living by 
selling various objects from door to door .This was the way he earned money to 
pay for his school.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One day , as he was walking from house to house 
as usual , he felt very hungry and weak. he felt that he could not walk even a 
few steps .He decided to ask for food at a house .He knocked on the door and was 
stunned to see a beautiful young girl open the door . With much hesitation, he 
asked the girl for a glass of water.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The young girl understood his condition and 
offered him a huge glass of milk . with an astonished look , the boy drank the 
milk very slowly</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How 
much do I owe you for this milk ? He asked her </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The girl replied I do not want any money for this</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The boy thanked the girl from the bottom of his 
heart and left the place</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Years passed by the young girl grew up . in her 
youth , unfortunately , she fell ill and was diagnosed with her rarest kind of 
nervous disorder .Many experienced doctors were baffled at her condition and she 
was admitted in the city hospital with the most advanced facilities</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Dr .Kevin , a renowned neuro specialist was 
called in by the hospital to examine her.Even with his extraordinary expertise, 
Dr .kevin found the girl`s illness very hard to cure .However, with perseverance 
and hard work that lasted months, he was finally able to get the disease under 
control .with careful medication and monitoring , the girl was completely cured 
in the end .</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Every one praised the doctor ,but the girl was 
quite worried about how much the hospital bill would come to .her family had 
just a little money kept away in the bank , which was by no means enough to pay 
for such a long treatment in that reputed hospital.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">the girl was given the hospital bill finally 
.With trembling hands , she opened it .she was stunned to see that the bill had 
been crossed out and cancelled , and there was a note underneath&nbsp; signed by 
Dr . kevin.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&nbsp;!Bill paid years ago with a glass of milk
</font></p>
