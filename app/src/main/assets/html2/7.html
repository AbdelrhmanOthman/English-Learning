<p align="left"><font size="4">The deer Said &quot;That is right , I can . But Now I 
am busy .Why do not you ask bear for help ?&quot;l</font></p>

you are very strong . please help me. some wild dogs are after me . please chase 
them away&quot; he requested to the bear</font></p>

tired . I need to find some food . please ask the monkey for help</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Poor Bunny went to the monkey , the elephant, the 
goat and all his other friends . Bunny felt sad that nobody was ready to help 
him.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">He understood that he had to think of a way out 
by himself . He hid under a bush . He lay very still . the wild dogs did not 
find the Bunny . they went chasing other animals</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Bunny rabbit learnt that he had to learn to 
survive by himself , not depending on his unhelpful friends</font></p>

depend on others</font></p>
