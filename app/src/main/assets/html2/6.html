<p align="left"><font size="4">Little Molly lived in a small beautiful town . 
her tiny house is constructed on the banks of a beautiful river , near the 
mountain. she was the only daughter for her parent .Although they were not very 
rich, they lived happily</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Her house was surrounded by huge trees and 
beautiful plants . it was a single bedded house ,made of woods . Molly did not 
like her house very much. She felt that the house was too small and not very 
neat. Little molly was very fond of the mountain . The steep and sloppy mountain 
had a beautiful but abandoned castle like home with golden windows.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Yes , she liked the home on top of the mountain 
because of the glittering golden windows. the windows sparkled and glazed so 
beautiful that little Molly was completely mesmerized</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">She went crazy for that the glittering golden 
windows and she started to hate her home more.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">However, little Molly was so sweet and she 
understand the struggles her family undergoing . so she accepted everything 
silently Still her desire went on growing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Years passed by and she grew up quickly. she 
became 12years old and looked very beautiful like a golden princess .she 
believed that she is supposed to live in a house with golden windows, not in an 
old wood house</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">As she grown older , her mom allowed her to move 
around her house .it was holidays for Molly and she requested her mom that she 
wanted to wonder in the garden near the river not to go so far.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Molly decided to climb the mountain and peek into 
the house with the golden windows</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">She took her bicycle and started her journey 
towards reaching the top of mountain. She found a narrow road in the mountain&nbsp; 
towards the abandoned home in the mountain . with so many struggels , she 
reached the top of the mountain</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">She was so shocked to see the dirties house , in 
fact the damaged castle with dark windows .What she used to see from her home 
was not there in the mountain. yes , the golden windows she saw from the lap of 
the mountain were in fact the reflection of the dark and dirty windows</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">She was very upset and sat quietly for some time 
as she lost words . her desire got vanished. suddenly, she looked at her home . 
A window in her was shining like gold . she realized that the sun rays 
reflecting in the water makes the window glows</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The truth was she lived in her dream home , the 
home with beautiful golden windows . she realized it too late . What she dreamt 
for years just vanished away .</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">So understand that all glitters are not gold</font></p>
