<p align="left"><font size="4">Once upon a time , there was&nbsp; a hungry fox 
that was&nbsp; looking for something to eat . He was very hungry No matter how 
hard he tried , the fox could not&nbsp; find food. Finally he went to the edge 
of the forest and searched there for food suddenly he caught sight of a big tree 
with a hole in it .</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Inside the hole was a package . the hungry fox 
immediately thought that there might be food in it , and became very happy . He 
jumped into the hole when he opened the package , he saw slices of bread&nbsp; , 
meat and fruit in it </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">An old woodcutter had placed the food in the tree 
trunk before he began to cut down trees in the forest . He was going to eat it 
foe his lunch.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The fox happily began to eat . After he finished 
eating , he felt thirsty and decided to leave the hole and drink some water from 
a nearby spring. However , no matter how hard he tried, he could not get out of 
the hole. Do you know why/ yes , the fox had eaten too much food that he became 
too big to fit through the hole</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The fox was very sad and upset. He told himself&nbsp; 
I wish I had thought a little before jumping into the hole </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Yes children , this is the result of doing 
something without thinking about it first .</font></p>
