<p align="left"><font size="4">Sam was a greedy and selfish man .he always 
desired to have lots and lots of money and never hesitated to cheat others to 
make money . Also , he never wished to share anything with others He paid very 
low wages to his servants</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">However , one day he learned a lesson that 
changed his life forever </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">It so happened that one day , a small bag that 
belonged to Sam was missing The bag had 50 gold coins in it . Sam searched high 
and law for the bag , but could not find it .Sam `s friends and neighbours also 
joined in the search , but all their efforts were in vain</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">After a couple of days , the ten year old 
daughter of a man working for Sam found the bag . She told her father about it . 
her father identified the bag as the one that was missing , and immediately 
decided top take it to his master</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">He gave the bag back to his master Sam and asked 
him to check whether the bag had 500gold coins . Sam was exultant to get&nbsp; 
the coins back, but he decided to play a trick . He shouted at his worker &quot;there 
were 75 gold coins in this bag but you gave me only 50! Where are the other 
coins ?You have stolen them !&quot;l</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The worker was shocked to hear this and pleaded 
his innocence , selfish and greedy , Sam did not accept the worker`s story , and 
decided to take issue to court</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The judge heard both the sides . he questioned 
the daughter and the worker about the number of coins they had found in the bag 
, and they assured it was only 50</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">He cross -examined Sam and Sam replies &quot;Yes my 
lord , I had 75 gold coins in my bag , and they gave me only 50 hence it is 
quite obvious that they have stolen 25 coins</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The judge then asked &quot; are you sure that your bag 
had 75 coins</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Sam nodded vigorously</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The judge then made his judgment</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">&quot;Since Sam lost a bag of 75 gold coins and the 
bag found by the girl had only 50cins it is obvious that the bag that was found 
not belong to Sam /. it was lost by someone else . if any one found a bag of 75 
gold coins , i will declare that it belongs to Sam .As there are no complaints 
about the loss of 50coins I order the girl and his father to take those 50coins 
as&nbsp; a token of appreciation for their honesty&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Honesty will always be rewarded and greed 
punished</font></p>
