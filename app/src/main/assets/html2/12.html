<p align="left"><font size="4">A father had a family of sons Who were 
perpetually quarreling among themselves . When he failed to heal their disputes 
by his exhortations , he determined to give them a practical illustration of the 
evils of disunion</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">One day he told his sons to bring him a bundle of 
sticks . When they had done so , he placed the fagot into the hands of each of 
them in succession , and ordered them to break it in pieces. they tried with all 
their strength , and wee not able to do it . he next opened the fagot took the 
sticks separately , one by one and again&nbsp; put them into his son`s hands 
upon which they broke them easily . He then addressed them in these words :</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">My sons , if you are of one mind and unit to 
assist each other , you will be as strong as this fagot , uninjured by all the 
attempts of your enemies , but&nbsp; if you are divided among yourselves , you 
will be broken as easily as these sticks </font></p>
